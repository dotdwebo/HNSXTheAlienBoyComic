After The Alien Boy crash landed in to Earth, many of the boys were beat (just check out the bruises and the bandages). 

As they were recovering, they realized they needed to open up their websites from outer space.

Fortunately, they used Handshake domains, and stupid Earthlings couldnâ€™t censor them. 

As the boys healed with their health packs, they accessed their outer space websites on web3 with their own .thealienboy userIDs
